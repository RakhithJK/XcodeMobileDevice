# Xcode & MobileDevice reverse engineering
This project aims to uncover the mystery about Xcode and MobileDevice framework to make it easier for developers to communicate and debug their mobile devices.  
Please do note that the reverse engineered code is proprietary property of Apple Inc.  
I refer to excemptions stated in the DMCA act for educational use Section 1201(a)(1)(C).  
The code presented here is solely for the purpose of educating developers, not for them to make use of it.  
If GitHub will proceed action when any of the involved parties claims a DMCA violation is made, I have good beliefs to think that will be an act of censorship.
